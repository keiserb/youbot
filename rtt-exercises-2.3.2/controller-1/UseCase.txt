Imagine you have a robot ('plant') which can be driven by a joystick ('manual mode'), or 
which executes a motion script ('automatic mode'). You want to be able to 
switch between these two at any time at run-time. So you'll have a 'plant' 
component (providing hardware access), a 'joystick' component ( reading the 
joystick ), an 'automatic' component which executes the script,
a 'controller' component which closes the position control loop, 
a 'manual' component which converts joystick position setpoints directly to 
robot velocity setpoints and a 'mode switch' component which manages 
switching between the two modes (automatic->controller->plant or joystick->plant), 
possibly using an external IO switch. Of course, the application is setup 
using the 'DeploymentComponent' XML format.
